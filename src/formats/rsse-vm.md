# RSEE VM

Theme Park World uses a stack-based VM in order to give rides and sideshows their functionality. This VM reads from the [RSSE](https://github.com/ThemeParkWorld/OpenTPW/wiki/RSSE-(Ride-&-Sideshow-Script-Engine)) format, and includes over 100 instructions.

## Common Variable Set

The following variables are part of a "common variable set" that must be contained within every ride (these do not apply to features).

- `VAR_LETMEON` (0) - First ID of visitor in ride queue
- `VAR_LETMEOFF` (1) - First ID of visitor wishing to leave
- `VAR_CAPACITY` (2) - How many visitors can use the ride at once
- `VAR_DURATION` (3) - The time for the ride to run for
- `VAR_BREAKSTAT` (4) - Whether the ride is broken (1) or not (0)
- `VAR_ONRIDE` (5) - The number of visitors on the ride
- `VAR_RIDECLOSED` (6) - Is the ride closed? (0/1)
- `VAR_BROKEN` (7) - Is the ride broken? (0/1)
- `VAR_WORN` (8) - How worn is the ride?
- `VAR_RUNNING` (9) - Is the ride running? (0/1)
- `VAR_PAD` (10) - Unused
- `VAR_PARAM` (11) - Sideshows: Determine whether the current visitor will win (1) or lose (0)
